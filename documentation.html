  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <p>This is my server-side component of a movies web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create lists of their favorite movies or categorize movies after a certain viewpoint themselves.</p>
  <p>Together with the client-side component made using React as Framework this application builds up to a complete web application using Full-Stack JavaScript Technologies. The project includes APIs, Web Server, Frameworks, Databases, Business Logic, Authentication, Data Security, and more. This complete tech stack is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) Stack.</p>
  <p>The   REST   API  
    will   be   accessed   via   commonly   used   HTTP   methods   like   GET   and   POST.   Similar   methods  
    (CRUD)   will   be   used   to   retrieve   data   from   your   database   and   store   that   data   in   a   non-relational  
    way. </p>
