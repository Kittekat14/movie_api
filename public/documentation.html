  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <p>This is my server-side component of a movies web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create lists of their favorite movies or categorize movies after a certain viewpoint themselves.</p>
  <p>Together with the client-side component made using React as Framework this application builds up to a complete web application using Full-Stack JavaScript Technologies. The project includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>APIs,</li>
    <li>Web Server,</li>
    <li>Frameworks,</li>
    <li>Databases,</li>
    <li>Business Logic,</li>
    <li>Authentication,</li>
    <li>Data Security, and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This complete tech stack is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) Stack. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way.
